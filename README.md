# README for Python Image Processing API

This Python code represents a Flask-based API for processing images. It utilizes the [rembg](https://pypi.org/project/rembg/) library to remove backgrounds from images and the [PIL (Pillow)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library for image manipulation. The API allows users to send an image for background removal and then returns the processed image with the background removed.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this API on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- rembg
- Pillow (PIL)
- flask_cors

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install Flask rembg Pillow flask_cors
```
Running the API
Clone or download the code from the repository.

Navigate to the directory containing the code.

Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python your_filename.py
Replace your_filename.py with the name of the Python file containing the code (the file where this code is placed).

The API should now be running locally. You can access it using a tool like Postman or by making HTTP requests from your application.
